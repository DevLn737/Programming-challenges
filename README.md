# Programming Challenges Repository

This repository is designed for my personal use to learn and practice programming in various languages and technologies. Solutions are provided in multiple programming languages. Ideally, solutions should be presented as web or desktop applications; CLI is allowed but not preferred. CLI can be used as a temporary solution or if the task is more practical, convenient, or otherwise better suited to this format.

## Introduction

This repository contains a selection of programming assignments covering a wide range of topics, from simple tasks to complex tasks. The main goal is to learn something new, get acquainted with different programming languages and just have fun. As I find new tests, they will be added to this repository, most likely in their own separate category.

I am an absolute beginner, so my solutions may not be elegant, but even on the contrary, as wrong and crooked as possible, so it is not necessary to focus on the solutions in this repository, but rather make your own.
